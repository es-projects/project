## Usefull routes
`/users` - Users list <br>
`/groups` - Groups list <br>
`/advisors` - Advisors list <br>
`/students` - Students list <br>
`/projects` - Projects list <br>
`/project_applications` - Projects Applications list

## Default Users
All the users are generated in the seeds.<br>
The default admin user is `admin@sapo.pt` with password `password`.

## Getting Started
### Starting a new Rails Project
You don't need to do this step (reference only), the project is already created
```bash
rails new . --database=postgresql --skip-coffee
```

### Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/es-projects/projects.git
```

### Start the VM
Start the virtual machine and ssh into it:
```bash
vagrant up && vagrant ssh
```

### Starting the Rails Server
```bash
cd /vagrant
rails server --binding 0.0.0.0
```
You can now access it on `localhost:3000`

### Database 
Delete all databases
```bash
rails db:drop
```
Create databases
```bash
rails db:create
```
Run migrations 
```bash
rails db:migrate
```
Seed
```bash
rails db:seed
```

### Tests
Running tests
```bash
RAILS_ENV=test rails test
```
Running system tests
```bash
RAILS_ENV=test rails test:system
```

### Destroy the VM
If you mess up something just destroy the machine and then start it again
```bash
vagrant halt
vagrant destroy
vagrant up
```

### Bugs
If the symlink creation fails on Windows you have to run vagrant with administrator privileges.
First stop the vm
```bash 
vagrant halt
```
Then run CMD or git bash or whatever you use to run vagrant with administrator privileges (Right-Click -> Run as administrator)
```bash
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
yarn install --check-files
```

## Vagrant File
The vagrant file uses the [jadesystems/rails-5-2](https://app.vagrantup.com/jadesystems/boxes/rails-5-2) base box with a script to update some apps

### Versions
*   npm 6.12.1
*   Ruby 2.6.5
*   Yarn 1.19.2
*   PSQL 10.10
*   Rails 6.0.1
*   Redis 4.0.9
*   NodeJS 12.13.1

## Configuration
*   `config/database.yml` - PostgreSQL DB config file

## Database
The script will create the `vagrant_development`, `vagrant_test` and `vagrant_production` databases and setup the PSQL environment automatically.

The default database user name and password are `vagrant`

## User setup
You can, of course, change the database owner or password. To do so:
```bash
sudo -u postgres psql -c "create role pg with superuser createdb login password 'pg';"
```

Then change the user name and password in all the appropriate places in `config/database.yml`
